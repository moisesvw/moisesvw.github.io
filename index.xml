      <description>This project aims to build a predictive model that learn to identify attributes associated with each animal. It was part of hackerearth.com Challenge. It provides 18.000 images of 50 different categories, 12.600 have animal characteristics. These characteristics are treated as labels to train a predictive model that learns to map animal images to attributes. This set of 12600 images will be the training set.
Metrics There are 85 different attributes per image in the training set.</description>

      <description>About Here there are all of the projects I&amp;rsquo;ve worked on during the Udacity&amp;rsquo;s Self Driving Car Engineer Nanodegree program.
Term 1 Finding Lane Lines I have detected highway lane lines on a video stream â€” used OpenCV image analysis techniques to identify lane lines, including Hough Transforms and Canny edge detection.
Traffic Sign Classifier Built and trained a deep neural network to classify traffic signs, using TensorFlow. Experimented with different network architectures.</description>

      <description>This post&amp;rsquo;s about how to install TensorFlow, numpy, OpenCV and Jupyter to be prepared to run Deep Learning models in a local environment using either python 2.7 or python 3.6.
Miniconda Miniconda is a package manager that allows creating virtual environments; this enables different python versions and libraries isolated from others. The next link points to the miniconda version for different O.S platforms https://conda.io/miniconda.html. The Mac OS X version it is used in this tutorial.</description>

      <description>Machine Learning Engineer Nanodegree Algorithms and Techniques Convolutional Neural Network (ConvNet) as classifier. The network has several parameters that needs to be tuned, including number of epochs, batch size, learning rate, max pool layers and dropout layers. This technique and its parameters are discussed above.
The ConvNet is trained using back-propagation to learn the weight parameters, these weights are used to activate neurons. The main difference of the ConvNet with respect to a regular neural network is that it is specifically designed to recognize visual patterns directly from the image pixels [4].</description>

      <description>Finding Lane Lines on the Road Intro In self-driving car detecting lane lines, it is necessary to guide vehicles in the roads This project shows several techniques needed to achieve this important task. The the goal is to find both left and right lane lines by plotting colored lines over its respective lane lines pixels in the image.
