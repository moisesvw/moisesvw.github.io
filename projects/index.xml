      <description>This project aims to build a predictive model that learn to identify attributes associated with each animal. It was part of hackerearth.com Challenge. It provides 18.000 images of 50 different categories, 12.600 have animal characteristics. These characteristics are treated as labels to train a predictive model that learns to map animal images to attributes. This set of 12600 images will be the training set.
Metrics There are 85 different attributes per image in the training set.</description>

      <description>About Here there are all of the projects I&amp;rsquo;ve worked on during the Udacity&amp;rsquo;s Self Driving Car Engineer Nanodegree program.
Term 1 Finding Lane Lines I have detected highway lane lines on a video stream â€” used OpenCV image analysis techniques to identify lane lines, including Hough Transforms and Canny edge detection.
Traffic Sign Classifier Built and trained a deep neural network to classify traffic signs, using TensorFlow. Experimented with different network architectures.</description>
